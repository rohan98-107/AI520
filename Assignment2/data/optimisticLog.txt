***** GAME STARTING *****

10 by 10 board with 20 mines

Solving with LINEAR OPTIMIZATION strategy

Uncertainty: optimistic

Cell (1, 5) safely revealed with clue: 1.
	# safe neighbors: 0
	# mine neighbors: 0
	# hidden neighbors: 8
	# total neighbors: 8


Revealing cell (1, 5) led to no conclusive next move (either DETONATED or all neighbors MINES).

Will attempt to re-deduce & enqueue new safe cell(s) from all of current knowledge,

or add random if none available.
