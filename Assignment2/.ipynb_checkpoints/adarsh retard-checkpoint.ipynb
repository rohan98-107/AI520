It then tries to deduce, based solely on the 8 cells adjacent to it, whether or not any of the 9 cells in question are definitely safe or definitely a mine. Clearly, the chosen cell does not need to be inferred, but the 8 cells adjacent can generally not be inferred on the first move *unless* the clue is 0, as there is not enough information yet. Mathematically, we can denote this as: $P(X_{i,j} = 0 | C) = (1-d)^9$ where $C$ is the board configuration and $d$ is the mine density (Note: we are assuming the first cell queried is *not* a corner or edge cell, but our implementation handles all cases).  \n",

    "When enough of the board has been filled, the metrics of each cell start to be the main source of knowledge for the agent. At every cell $(x,y)$, the agent keeps track of $(x,y)$'s total neighbors, its safe neighbors, mine neighbors and hidden neighbors, which can be used for marking more cells as safe/unsafe. This is **local inference.** For example, if a cell has 8 total neighbors, 7 safe neighbors, 1 hidden neighbor and a clue of 1, the agent can determine with 100% certainty that the final neighbor is a mine. Once the agent can no longer make any reliable inferences, it returns to the last safe, visited cell which is stored in a queue. If the queue is empty, the agent returns to random selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recrunching the KB via local inference prior to random selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in cases where the algorithm falls to random selection, it first reprocesses its entire knowledge base by repeating how it parses clues (as above) to conduct local inference. That is, it iterates over all currently safe, uncovered cells and re-calculates number of safe neighbors, mine neighbors, hidden neighbors, etc. and possibly infers mine/safety. That way, it deduces as much knowledge as possible prior, possibly enqueueing safe cells to visit next or marking cells as mines. \n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind this is to minimize the number of mines which are accidentally detonated by random selection when, in fact, the current knowledge base contains that information. We don't need to uncover new cells to retrieve that information; our KB just needs to be \"re-crunched\" in terms of local inference to retrieve this insight. Then we filter out some of those mines that could have been randomly selected and improve our baseline without doing anything beyond simple local inference.\n",

In previous iterations of our implementation, the agent solely relied on the system of linear equations.

    "This hybrid algorithm is quite powerful largely because it relies solely on computational methods and utilizes the full extent of the knowledge base at every iteration. In the above excerpt, which depicts a single iteration by the Linear Algebra/Brute Force Agent, the cell $(8,8)$ was revealed but did not provide enough information to the knowledge base for the linear algebra method to yield useful results. The Brute Force Agent then calculated all the possible mine configurations for the remaining cells and was able to find that cell $(9,9)$ had the least probability of being a mine, which it then chose to visit next. Had there been two minimum probabilities, the agents would have had no choice but to pick a random cell. \n",

Without this cap, we would expect vanilla brute force to outperform vanilla linear algebra  nearly always. \n",

Accordingly, instead of merely revealing the actual clue via `clue = self.game.board[x][y]`, we now use the `getClue(...)` function found in `Agent.py` which returns an uncertain clue. Note that toggling between these types of uncertain clues, as well as having no uncertainty (as before), is done via the `self.uncertaintyType` attribute in the `Agent` class.\n",

    "We see that the agent acting on optimistic clue knowledge is uniformly worse than the baseline agent, with flag rates approximately 50% lower. This is because with clues which possibly reveal fewer mine neighbors, the agent is unable to deduce as many deterministically mine neighbors. It also may incorrectly determine some cells are safe, because the clue is an underestimate. This fact holds true using the linear algebra + brute force approach as well.\n",

    "Similarly to our linear algebra discussion earlier, consider the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n \\geq C$, where $x_i$ is a cell which is 1 if mine, 0 if safe, and $C$ is the given clue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we naturally see that $\\sum_{i}x_i$ gives the true number of mines, and $C$ underestimates this: representing exactly this case of **optimistic clues.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging this, we turn our discussion of linear algebra to the discussion of [linear optimization,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) which is the related field considering systems of linear equations where each equation represents not an equality but a constraint ($\\geq$ or $\\leq$), and a solution is optimal if it maximizes or minimizes a certain objective function of the variables $z = f(x_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we utilize systems of linear equations in the linear algebra method above, we see it convenient to adapt this portion to a linear optimization model. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Linear optimization theory & implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We write another linear optimization agent which inherits from the linear algebra + brute force agent above, with the following simple change: **Instead of finding a solution to the system, we are trying to find the optimal one.** If none can be found, then simply revert to solving the system as before, regardless of the clues' accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "See `LinOpt.py` for more implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our optimal clue case, we are considering systems where each equation is of the form: $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n \\geq C$. The linear programming problem we use is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Max $z = \\sum_{i}x_i$ subject to constraints $Ax \\geq b, x_i \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the expression $Ax \\geq b$ is nothing more than the system of equations laid out in a matrix with $\\geq$ symbols instead of $=$ symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary method of solving linear programming problems is the [simplex method,](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~scniu/OPRE-6201/documents/LP4-Simplex.html) which takes in the augmented matrix $[A | b]$ with a row added to represent the objective function, called the **initial tableau.** Then, it iteratively uses row operations to return a matrix with the solution to the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the simplex method requires initial tableaus be converted to a specific [canonical form:](https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/wakefiel/_files/documents/sa305/notes/note3-25.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "Max $z$ s.t. $Ax = b, x_i \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [Two Phase Simplex Method](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~ffischer/teaching/opt/notes/notes8.pdf) here to solve this system. Without diving too much into linear optimization theory, this requires us to pass in a different augmented matrix to mediate the problem of having $\\geq$ instead of $=$ symbols. Then, we solve the optimization problem and return the appropriate solution matrix. The below code walks through this process of transforming and solving, but see the `simplexOptimistic(...)` method in `LinOpt.py` for more implementation details."

    "### Implementation challenges for linear optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This method (for both optimistic and cautious clues) fails precisely because our problem is not well-suited to the mathematical reality of linear optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear optimization theory rests upon a very precise set of geometric conditions. Imagine plotting each constraint inequality, and the region bounded by all these lines. For our system of linear Minesweeper equations, would this region ever exist? What would it look like? In fact, every linear programming problem must have a feasible and convex region of points, i.e. the [feasible region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region), which satisfies the conditions presented by the constraints; without this, the problem will not return a solution. It does not appear that the systems of linear equations we are solving yield such a feasible region, given the failures of our trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, another issue may lie in our objective function: to maximize the total number of mines detected at each pass. This seems right in the sense of intelligent decision-making, but does not correspond to mathematical reality.\n",
    "Consider the case of optimistic clues. Intuitively, if each constraint is uses a $\\geq$ symbol and the objective function is to maximize a certain value, then it would appear that even if there was a feasible region, then there wouldn't be an optimal solution; one might be able to increase the objective function infinitely. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we would have to re-think both of these points. We might end up needing to implement a different method of getting a system of linear equations, e.g. one which solves for safe cells, and not mine cells. Then the system would want to maximize the number of safe cells detected at each pass, because those cells give us new actionable information for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also change our objective function to minimize the number of detected mines, to be as conservative as possible. That would mean trying to define the number of detected mines as a function of the mine cells in the system of linear equations used here, or perhaps a modified system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might even want to explore looking at the implications of the theory of [duality,](http://web.mit.edu/15.053/www/AMP-Chapter-04.pdf) finding dual problems to the ones at hand, and attempting to solve those.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, linear optimization seems to head in the right intuitive direction, but either is not well-suited to solving Minesweeper with uncertain clues, or needs significant massaging which would depart from the core of the linear algebra systems relayed here."
