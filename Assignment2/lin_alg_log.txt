Solving with LINEAR ALGEBRA strategy



Cell (0, 2) safely revealed with clue: 0.
	# safe neighbors: 0
	# mine neighbors: 0
	# hidden neighbors: 5
	# total neighbors: 5


All neighbors of (0, 2) must be safe.

	Neighbor (0, 3) flagged as safe and enqueued for next visitation.

	Neighbor (0, 1) flagged as safe and enqueued for next visitation.

	Neighbor (1, 2) flagged as safe and enqueued for next visitation.

	Neighbor (1, 3) flagged as safe and enqueued for next visitation.

	Neighbor (1, 1) flagged as safe and enqueued for next visitation.

----------------------------------------

Cell (0, 3) safely revealed with clue: 0.

Revealing cell (1, 0) led to no conclusive next move (either DETONATED or all neighbors MINES).

Will attempt to re-deduce & enqueue new safe cell(s) from all of current knowledge,

or add random if none available.
