It then tries to deduce, based solely on the 8 cells adjacent to it, whether or not any of the 9 cells in question are definitely safe or definitely a mine. Clearly, the chosen cell does not need to be inferred, but the 8 cells adjacent can generally not be inferred on the first move *unless* the clue is 0. Mathematically, we can denote this as: $P(X_{i,j} = 0 | C) = (1-d)^9$ where $C$ is the board configuration and $d$ is the mine density (Note: we are assuming the first cell queried is *not* a corner or edge cell, but our implementation handles all cases).  \n",

For example, if a cell has 8 total neighbors, 7 safe neighbors, 1 hidden neighbor and a clue of 1, the agent can determine with 100% certainty that the final neighbor is a mine.
