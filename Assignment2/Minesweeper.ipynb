    "As is the baseline or \"naive\" approach to minesweeper, our solver algorithm begins with a random first move (i.e. revealing a cell). It then tries to deduce, based solely on the 8 cells adjacent to it, whether or not any of the 9 cells in question are definitely safe or definitely a mine. Clearly, the chosen cell does not need to be inferred, but the 8 cells adjacent can generally not be inferred on the first move *unless* the clue is 0. Mathematically, we can denote this as: $P(X_{i,j} = 0 | C) = (1-d)^9$ where $C$ is the board configuration and $d$ is the mine density (Note: we are assuming the first cell queried is *not* a corner or edge cell, but our implementation handles all cases).  \n",

At every cell $(x,y)$, the agent keeps track of $(x,y)$'s total neighbors, its safe neighbors, mine neighbors and hidden neighbors, which can be used for marking more cells as safe/unsafe. For example, if a cell has 8 total neighbors, 7 safe neighbors, 1 hidden neighbor and a clue of 1, the agent can determine with 100% certainty that the final neighbor is a mine.

    "This section dealt with a variation of the MineSweeper game in which the clue itself is not assumed to be correct. That is, we deal with uncertainty on the accuracy of the clue itself. Accordingly, instead of merely revealing the actual clue via `clue = self.game.board[x][y]`, we now use the `getClue(...)` function found in `Agent.py` which returns an uncertain clue. Note that toggling between these types of uncertain clues, as well as having no uncertainty (as before), is done via the `self.uncertaintyType` attribute in the `Agent` class.\n",

Without diving too much into linear optimization theory, this requires us to pass in a different augmented matrix to mediate the problem of having $\\geq$ instead of $=$ symbols. Then, we solve the optimization problem and return the appropriate solution matrix. The below code walks through this process of transforming and solving, but see the `simplexOptimistic(...)` method in `LinOpt.py` for more implementation details."

    "### Implementation challenges for linear optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This method (for both optimistic and cautious clues) fails precisely because our problem is not well-suited to the mathematical reality of linear optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear optimization theory rests upon a very precise set of geometric conditions. Imagine plotting each constraint inequality, and the region bounded by all these lines. For our system of linear Minesweeper equations, would this region ever exist? What would it look like? In fact, every linear programming problem must have a feasible and convex region of points, i.e. the [feasible region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region), which satisfies the conditions presented by the constraints; without this, the problem will not return a solution. It does not appear that the systems of linear equations we are solving yield such a feasible region, given the failures of our trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, another issue may lie in our objective function: to maximize the total number of mines detected at each pass. This seems right in the sense of intelligent decision-making, but does not correspond to mathematical reality.\n",
    "Consider the case of optimistic clues. Intuitively, if each constraint is uses a $\\geq$ symbol and the objective function is to maximize a certain value, then it would appear that even if there was a feasible region, then there wouldn't be an optimal solution; one might be able to increase the objective function infinitely. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we would have to re-think both of these points. We might end up needing to implement a different method of getting a system of linear equations, e.g. one which solves for safe cells, and not mine cells. Then the system would want to maximize the number of safe cells detected at each pass, because those cells give us new actionable information for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also change our objective function to minimize the number of detected mines, to be as conservative as possible. That would mean trying to define the number of detected mines as a function of the mine cells in the system of linear equations used here, or perhaps a modified system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might even want to explore looking at the implications of the theory of [duality,](http://web.mit.edu/15.053/www/AMP-Chapter-04.pdf) finding dual problems to the ones at hand, and attempting to solve those.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, linear optimization seems to head in the right intuitive direction, but either is not well-suited to solving Minesweeper with uncertain clues, or needs significant massaging which would depart from the core of the linear algebra systems relayed here."
